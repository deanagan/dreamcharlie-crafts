## Project Setup

This project was not originally typescript but was converted into typescript via the following steps:

1. npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
2. Renamed all .js/x to .ts/x files.
3. Used React.FC.


## Adding Redux

1. Adding needed packages:

    ```
    npm install redux react-redux redux-thunk
    ```

2. Adding types (newer versions don't need types for react-redux and redux-thunk):

    ```
    npm install @types/redux
    ```
